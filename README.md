# conkyround
conky config files, based on Conky-Minimalism by Fleming Henry

Rounded conky, semi-transparent background, lua rings, CPU bar graphs, CPU and GPU temps, etc.

Do note that this config may not work out of the box on all systems, it was coded on Void Linux, which means some variables might be different in more standard distributions.
